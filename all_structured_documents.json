        "introduction": "The Grade 1 Standards place emphasis on counting, representing, comparing, and ordering sets of objects up to 120; recognizing, describing, and transferring repeating and growing patterns; and analyzing and sorting plane figures. Students’ understanding of number is expanded through recognizing and describing part-part-whole relationships for numbers up to 10, recalling addition and subtraction facts to 10 with automaticity, as well as solving problems using addition and subtraction within 20. Students will begin the study of fractions by solving problems that involve partitioning models into two and four equal-sized parts. Students will use nonstandard units to measure and compare objects by length, weight, and volume. Students will engage with the data cycle using object graphs, picture graphs, and tables. The data cycle includes formulating questions to be explored with data; collecting or acquiring data; organizing and representing data; and analyzing data and communicating results. The use of appropriate technology and the interpretation of the results from applying technology tools must be an integral part of teaching, learning, and assessment. While learning mathematics, students will be actively engaged, using concrete materials and appropriate technologies to facilitate problem solving. However, facility in the use of technology shall not be regarded as a substitute for a student’s understanding of quantitative and algebraic concepts or for proficiency in basic computations. The acquisition of specialized mathematical vocabulary and language is crucial to a student’s understanding and appreciation of the subject and fosters confidence in mathematics communication and problem solving. Problem-solving is integrated throughout the content strands. The development of problem-solving skills is a major goal of the mathematics program at every grade level. The development of skills and problem-solving strategies must be integrated early and continuously into each student’s mathematics education.",

        "introduction": "The Mathematics Instructional Guide, a companion document to the 2023 Mathematics Standards of Learning, amplifies the Standards of Learning by defining the core knowledge and skills in practice, supporting teachers and their instruction, and serving to transition classroom instruction from the 2016 Mathematics Standards of Learning to the newly adopted 2023 Mathematics Standards of Learning. Instructional supports are accessible in #GoOpenVA and support the decisions local school divisions must make concerning local curriculum development and how best to help students meet the goals of the standards. The local curriculum should include a variety of information sources, readings, learning experiences, and forms of assessment selected at the local level to create a rigorous instructional program. For a complete list of the changes by standard, the 2023 Virginia Mathematics Standards of Learning – Overview of Revisions is available and delineates in greater specificity the changes for each grade level and course. The Instructional Guide is divided into three sections: Understanding the Standard, Skills in Practice, and Concepts and Connections aligned to the Standard. The purpose of each is explained below."

        "introduction": "Geometry is a course designed for students who have successfully completed the Standards for Algebra 1. The course includes an emphasis on developing reasoning skills through the exploration of geometric relationships including properties of geometric figures, trigonometric relationships, and mathematical proofs. In this course, students use various types of reasoning, justification, and methods of direct and indirect proof and interpret and determine the validity of conditional statements. Venn diagrams are used to represent set relationships. This set of standards includes emphasis on two- and three-dimensional reasoning skills, coordinate and transformational geometry, and the use of geometric models to solve problems. A variety of applications and some general problem-solving techniques, including algebraic skills, should be used to implement these Standards. Technology tools and dynamic geometry applications will be used to assist in teaching and learning. Graphing technologies facilitate visualizing, analyzing, and understanding algebraic behaviors and geometric patterns and provide a powerful tool for visualizing and verifying solutions.",

        "introduction": "Algebra, Functions, and Data Analysis is a course designed for students who have successfully completed the Standards for Algebra 1 and may benefit from additional support in their transition to Algebra 2. Within the context of mathematical modeling and data analysis, students will study functions and their behaviors, systems of inequalities, probability, experimental design and implementation, and analysis of data. Data will be generated through practical applications arising from science, business, and finance. Students will solve problems that require the formulation of linear, quadratic, exponential, or piecewise-defined equations or a system of equations. Through the investigation of mathematical models and interpretation/analysis of data from relevant, applied contexts and situations, students will strengthen conceptual understandings in mathematics and further develop connections between algebra and statistics. Students should use the language and symbols of mathematics in representations and communication, both orally and in writing, throughout the course. These Standards include a transformational approach to graphing functions and writing equations when given the graph of the equation. Transformational graphing builds a strong connection between algebraic and graphic representations of functions. Technology tools will be used to assist in teaching and learning. Graphing technologies facilitate visualizing, analyzing, and understanding algebraic and statistical behaviors and provide a powerful tool for solving and verifying solutions.",

Instructional supports are accessible in #GoOpenVA and support the decisions local school divisions must make concerning local curriculum development and how best to help students meet the goals of the standards. The local curriculum should include a variety of information sources, readings, learning experiences, and forms of assessment selected at the local level to create a rigorous instructional program. For a complete list of the changes by standard, the 2023 Virginia Mathematics Standards of Learning – Overview of Revisions is available and delineates in greater specificity the changes for each grade level and course. The Instructional Guide is divided into three sections: Understanding the Standard, Skills in Practice, and Concepts and Connections aligned to the Standard. The purpose of each is explained below.",

        "introduction": "Students enrolled in Algebra 2 are assumed to have mastered the concepts outlined in the Algebra 1 Standards. Students earning an Advanced Studies Diploma are assumed to have mastered the content in the Algebra 2 Standards of Learning. A thorough treatment of advanced algebraic concepts will be provided through the study of functions, equations, inequalities, systems of equations, polynomials, rational and radical equations, complex numbers, and curves of best fit. Emphasis will be placed on contextual applications and modeling throughout the course of study. Oral and written communication concerning the language of algebra, logic of procedures, and interpretation of results should also permeate the course. These Standards include a transformational approach to graphing functions. Transformational graphing uses translation, reflection, dilation, and rotation to generate a “family of functions” from a given “parent” function and builds a strong connection between algebraic and graphic representations of functions. Students will vary the coefficients and constants of an equation, observe the changes in the graph of the equation, and make generalizations that can be applied to many graphs. Technology tools will be used to assist in teaching and learning. Graphing technologies facilitate visualizing, analyzing, making connections, and understanding algebraic and statistical behaviors and provide a powerful tool for solving and verifying solutions.",

Trigonometry includes the study of trigonometric definitions, applications, graphing, and solving trigonometric equations and inequalities. Emphasis should also be placed on using connections between right triangle ratios, trigonometric functions, and circular functions. In addition, the application of trigonometric concepts should be included throughout the course of study. Oral and written communication concerning the language of mathematics, logic of procedure, and interpretation of results should also permeate the course. Technology tools will be used to assist in teaching and learning. Graphing technologies facilitate visualizing, analyzing, and understanding algebraic and statistical behaviors and provide a powerful tool for solving and verifying solutions.",

Trigonometry includes the study of trigonometric definitions, applications, graphing, and solving trigonometric equations and inequalities. Emphasis should also be placed on using connections between right triangle ratios, trigonometric functions, and circular functions. In addition, the application of trigonometric concepts should be included throughout the course of study. Oral and written communication concerning the language of mathematics, logic of procedure, and interpretation of results should also permeate the course. Technology tools will be used to assist in teaching and learning. Graphing technologies facilitate visualizing, analyzing, and understanding algebraic and statistical behaviors and provide a powerful tool for solving and verifying solutions.",

        "introduction": "This course is intended to provide students with experiences in using computer programming techniques and skills to solve problems involving mathematical models. Students enrolled in Computer Mathematics are assumed to have studied the concepts and skills in Algebra 1 and beginning Geometry. Even though computer ideas should be introduced in the context of mathematical concepts, problem solving should be developed in the most general sense, allowing the techniques to be applied by students in many other environments. Strategies include defining the problem; developing, refining, and implementing a plan; and testing and revising the solution. Programming, ranging from simple programs involving only a few lines to complex programs involving subprograms, should permeate the entire course. Programming concepts, problem-solving strategies, and mathematical applications should be integrated throughout the course. These standards identify fundamental principles and concepts in the field of computer science that will be used within the context of mathematical problem solving in a variety of applications. As students develop and refine skills in logic, organization, and precise expression, they will apply those skills to enhance learning in all disciplines.",

      "introduction": "This course is intended to provide students with experiences in using computer programming techniques and skills to solve problems involving mathematical models. Students enrolled in Computer Mathematics are assumed to have studied the concepts and skills in Algebra 1 and beginning Geometry. Even though computer ideas should be introduced in the context of mathematical concepts, problem solving should be developed in the most general sense, allowing the techniques to be applied by students in many other environments. Strategies include defining the problem; developing, refining, and implementing a plan; and testing and revising the solution. Programming, ranging from simple programs involving only a few lines to complex programs involving subprograms, should permeate the entire course. Programming concepts, problem-solving strategies, and mathematical applications should be integrated throughout the course. These standards identify fundamental principles and concepts in the field of computer science that will be used within the context of mathematical problem solving in a variety of applications. As students develop and refine skills in logic, organization, and precise expression, they will apply those skills to enhance learning in all disciplines.",

If a one-semester course is desired, the standards with a dagger (†) would apply. The purpose of the course is to present basic concepts and techniques for collecting and analyzing data, drawing conclusions, and making predictions. Technology tools will be used to assist in teaching and learning. Graphing technologies facilitate visualizing, analyzing, and understanding algebraic and statistical behaviors and provide a powerful tool for solving and verifying solutions.",

If a one-semester course is desired, the standards with a dagger (†) would apply. The purpose of the course is to present basic concepts and techniques for collecting and analyzing data, drawing conclusions, and making predictions. Technology tools will be used to assist in teaching and learning. Graphing technologies facilitate visualizing, analyzing, and understanding algebraic and statistical behaviors and provide a powerful tool for solving and verifying solutions.",

      "introduction": "The following standards outline the content of a one-year course in Discrete Mathematics. If a one-semester course is desired, the standards with a dagger (†) would apply. Discrete Mathematics may be described as the study of mathematical properties of sets and systems that have a countable (discrete) number of elements. With the advent of modern technology, discrete (discontinuous) models have become as important as continuous models. In this course, the main focus is problem solving in a discrete setting. Techniques that are not considered in the current traditional courses of algebra, geometry, and calculus will be utilized. As students solve problems, they will analyze and determine whether a solution exists (existence problems), investigate how many solutions exist (counting problems), and focus on finding the best solution (optimization problems). Connections will be made to other disciplines. The importance of discrete mathematics has been influenced by technology. Technology tools will be used to assist in teaching and learning. Graphing technologies facilitate visualizing, analyzing, and understanding algebraic and statistical behaviors and provide a powerful tool for solving and verifying solutions.",

Discrete Mathematics may be described as the study of mathematical properties of sets and systems that have a countable (discrete) number of elements. With the advent of modern technology, discrete (discontinuous) models have become as important as continuous models. In this course, the main focus is problem solving in a discrete setting. Techniques that are not considered in the current traditional courses of algebra, geometry, and calculus will be utilized. As students solve problems, they will analyze and determine whether a solution exists (existence problems), investigate how many solutions exist (counting problems), and focus on finding the best solution (optimization problems). Connections will be made to other disciplines. The importance of discrete mathematics has been influenced by technology. Technology tools will be used to assist in teaching and learning. Graphing technologies facilitate visualizing, analyzing, and understanding algebraic and statistical behaviors and provide a powerful tool for solving and verifying solutions.",

      "introduction": "Developing foundational literacy skills is a priority in first grade. These skills include phonological and phonemic awareness, print awareness, phonics, fluency, language usage and handwriting. A student in first grade will learn and apply more complex phonics patterns when reading and writing while increasing their automaticity in reading words and connected text. The student will gain fluency when reading and rereading both phonetically controlled and uncontrolled texts. While foundational skills are a focus, it is equally important that the student continue to build world and word knowledge. Immersing the student in a text and language rich environment supports the student’s development of communication skills, vocabulary, comprehension, and an appreciation for reading and writing. The first-grade student will apply comprehension strategies when reading and listening to literary and informational texts and collaborating in classroom discussions. To support knowledge building, an emphasis will be given on materials connected to mathematics, science, and history and social science. The first-grade student will write in a variety of forms for specific purposes.",

Students will demonstrate fluency and recall with automaticity addition and subtraction facts within 20. Students will also solve single-step and multistep problems, including those in context, involving addition or subtraction of whole numbers where addends or minuends do not exceed 100. Students will begin to use U.S. Customary units to measure length, weight, and liquid volume to the nearest whole unit. Students will engage with the data cycle using pictographs and bar graphs. The data cycle includes formulating questions to be explored with data; collecting or acquiring data; organizing and representing data; and analyzing data and communicating results. The use of appropriate technology and the interpretation of the results from applying technology tools must be an integral part of teaching, learning, and assessment. While learning mathematics, students will be actively engaged, using concrete materials and appropriate technologies to facilitate problem solving. However, facility in the use of technology shall not be regarded as a substitute for a student’s understanding of quantitative and algebraic concepts or for proficiency in basic computations. The acquisition of specialized mathematical vocabulary and language is crucial to a student’s understanding and appreciation of the subject and fosters confidence in mathematics communication and problem solving. Problem-solving is integrated throughout the content strands. The development of problem-solving skills is a major goal of the mathematics program at every grade level. The development of skills and problem-solving strategies must be integrated early and continuously into each student’s mathematics education.",

Instructional supports are accessible in #GoOpenVA and support the decisions local school divisions must make concerning local curriculum development and how best to help students meet the goals of the standards. The local curriculum should include a variety of information sources, readings, learning experiences, and forms of assessment selected at the local level to create a rigorous instructional program. For a complete list of the changes by standard, the 2023 Virginia Mathematics Standards of Learning – Overview of Revisions is available and delineates in greater specificity the changes for each grade level and course. The Instructional Guide is divided into three sections: Understanding the Standard, Skills in Practice, and Concepts and Connections aligned to the Standard. The purpose of each is explained below."

      "introduction": "The Science Standards of Learning for Virginia Public Schools identify academic content for essential components of the science curriculum at different grade levels. The content of the standards, in conjunction with effective instruction, provide a platform for creating scientifically literate students. The Science Standards of Learning reflect a vertical progression of content and practices. The Standards of Learning contain content strands or topics that progress in complexity as they are studied at various grade levels in grades K-5 and are represented indirectly throughout the middle and high school courses. These strands are Scientific and Engineering Practices, Force, Motion, and Energy, Matter, Living Systems and Processes, Earth and Space Systems, Earth Resources. Six critical components for achieving science literacy are 1) Goals; 2) Investigate and Understand; 3) Nature of Science; 4) Science and Engineering Practices; 5) K-12 Safety; and 6) Instructional Technology. These six components support the Profile of a Virginia Graduate and an integrated instructional approach that incorporates science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is imperative to science instruction that the local curriculum consider and address how these components are incorporated in the design of the K-12 science program.",

        "introduction": "The Grade 3 Standards place emphasis on developing an understanding of the concepts of multiplication and division. Students will recall with automaticity multiplication facts through 10 × 10 and the corresponding division facts and will use this knowledge to solve contextual problems with multiplication and division. Students will extend knowledge of place value to six-digit whole numbers. Concrete models and pictorial representations will be used to deepen understanding of fraction concepts, including comparing, composing, and decomposing. Students will use standard units (U.S. Customary and metric) to measure length, weight/mass, and liquid volume. Students will be introduced to solving contextual problems involving elapsed time. Properties of shapes will be explored, and students will identify polygons, combine and subdivide polygons, and name the resulting polygon(s). Students will engage with the data cycle using pictographs and bar graphs. The data cycle includes formulating questions to be explored with data; collecting or acquiring data; organizing and representing data; and analyzing data and communicating results. Students will work with a variety of growing patterns using various representations. The use of appropriate technology and the interpretation of the results from applying technology tools must be an integral part of teaching, learning, and assessment. While learning mathematics, students will be actively engaged, using concrete materials and appropriate technologies to facilitate problem solving. However, facility in the use of technology shall not be regarded as a substitute for a student’s understanding of quantitative and algebraic concepts or for proficiency in basic computations. The acquisition of specialized mathematical vocabulary and language is crucial to a student’s understanding and appreciation of the subject and fosters confidence in mathematics communication and problem solving. Problem-solving is integrated throughout the content strands. The development of problem-solving skills is a major goal of the mathematics program at every grade level. The development of skills and problem-solving strategies must be integrated early and continuously into each student’s mathematics education."

Instructional supports are accessible in #GoOpenVA and support the decisions local school divisions must make concerning local curriculum development and how best to help students meet the goals of the standards. The local curriculum should include a variety of information sources, readings, learning experiences, and forms of assessment selected at the local level to create a rigorous instructional program. For a complete list of the changes by standard, the 2023 Virginia Mathematics Standards of Learning – Overview of Revisions is available and delineates in greater specificity the changes for each grade level and course. The Instructional Guide is divided into three sections: Understanding the Standard, Skills in Practice, and Concepts and Connections aligned to the Standard. The purpose of each is explained below.",

      "introduction": "The Grade 4 Standards place emphasis on multiplication and division with whole numbers and solving problems involving addition and subtraction of decimals and fractions with like denominators. Students will recall with automaticity multiplication through 12 × 12 and the corresponding division facts as they become proficient in multiplying and dividing larger numbers. Students will apply knowledge of place value and the properties of addition and multiplication as strategies for solving problems. Students will identify and describe representations of points, lines, line segments, rays, and angles, including endpoints and vertices. Students will describe and compare characteristics of plane and solid figures. Concrete models and pictorial representations will be used to solve problems involving perimeter and area, patterns, probability, and equivalence of fractions and decimals. Students will engage with the data cycle using line graphs. The data cycle includes formulating questions to be explored with data; collecting or acquiring data; organizing and representing data; and analyzing data and communicating results. The use of appropriate technology and the interpretation of the results from applying technology tools must be an integral part of teaching, learning, and assessment. While learning mathematics, students will be actively engaged, using concrete materials and appropriate technologies to facilitate problem solving. However, facility in the use of technology shall not be regarded as a substitute for a student’s understanding of quantitative and algebraic concepts or for proficiency in basic computations. The acquisition of specialized mathematical vocabulary and language is crucial to a student’s understanding and appreciation of the subject and fosters confidence in mathematics communication and problem solving. Problem-solving is integrated throughout the content strands. The development of problem-solving skills is a major goal of the mathematics program at every grade level. The development of skills and problem-solving strategies must be integrated early and continuously into each student’s mathematics education.",

        "introduction": "The Mathematics Instructional Guide, a companion document to the 2023 Mathematics Standards of Learning, amplifies the Standards of Learning by defining the core knowledge and skills in practice, supporting teachers and their instruction, and serving to transition classroom instruction from the 2016 Mathematics Standards of Learning to the newly adopted 2023 Mathematics Standards of Learning. Instructional supports are accessible in #GoOpenVA and support the decisions local school divisions must make concerning local curriculum development and how best to help students meet the goals of the standards. The local curriculum should include a variety of information sources, readings, learning experiences, and forms of assessment selected at the local level to create a rigorous instructional program. For a complete list of the changes by standard, the 2023 Virginia Mathematics Standards of Learning – Overview of Revisions is available and delineates in greater specificity the changes for each grade level and course. The Instructional Guide is divided into three sections: Understanding the Standard, Skills in Practice, and Concepts and Connections aligned to the Standard. The purpose of each is explained below.",

The student will apply comprehension strategies to monitor their understanding and to think critically about the grade level texts read. Collaborative conversations and writing about reading continue as an extension to expand students’ understanding of what they read. The student will read a variety of genres with a focus on realistic and historical fiction across cultures. The student will expand vocabulary using knowledge of roots, affixes, synonyms, antonyms, and homophones. The fourth-grade student continues to write in a variety of forms and purposes across content. Student writing in fourth grade gets more complex, and the student will use organizational structures to convey their message through writing. Working in diverse teams as both a facilitator and a contributor, the student will continue to increase communication and collaboration skills. The student will deliver multimodal presentations and begin to examine media messages. The student will demonstrate comprehension of the research process by evaluating the relevance and reliability of information collected to create a research product. Additionally, the student will continue to understand the difference between plagiarism and using their own words.",

      "introduction": "The Grade 5 Standards place emphasis on solving problems, including those in context, with whole numbers, fractions, and decimals. Students will develop an understanding of prime and composite numbers, determine the prime factorization of a whole number up to 100, and solve problems using order of operations. Students will also solve problems involving area, perimeter, and volume. Students will determine the probability of an outcome by constructing a model of a sample space and using the Fundamental (Basic) Counting Principle. Students will engage with the data cycle using line plots and stem-and-leaf plots. The data cycle includes formulating questions to be explored with data; collecting or acquiring data; organizing and representing data; and analyzing data and communicating results. Students will be introduced to expressions with a variable to support the development of the algebraic concepts necessary for success in the middle grades. The use of appropriate technology and the interpretation of the results from applying technology tools must be an integral part of teaching, learning, and assessment. While learning mathematics, students will be actively engaged, using concrete materials and appropriate technologies to facilitate problem solving. However, facility in the use of technology shall not be regarded as a substitute for a student’s understanding of quantitative and algebraic concepts or for proficiency in basic computations. The acquisition of specialized mathematical vocabulary and language is crucial to a student’s understanding and appreciation of the subject and fosters confidence in mathematics communication and problem solving. Problem-solving is integrated throughout the content strands. The development of problem-solving skills is a major goal of the mathematics program at every grade level. The development of skills and problem-solving strategies must be integrated early and continuously into each student’s mathematics education.",

Instructional supports are accessible in #GoOpenVA and support the decisions local school divisions must make concerning local curriculum development and how best to help students meet the goals of the standards. The local curriculum should include a variety of information sources, readings, learning experiences, and forms of assessment selected at the local level to create a rigorous instructional program. For a complete list of the changes by standard, the 2023 Virginia Mathematics Standards of Learning – Overview of Revisions is available and delineates in greater specificity the changes for each grade level and course. The Instructional Guide is divided into three sections: Understanding the Standard, Skills in Practice, and Concepts and Connections aligned to the Standard. The purpose of each is explained below.",

The student will continue to read a variety of literary and informational texts focusing on the author’s craft, style, and approach on a topic or concept. Collaborative conversations and writing about their reading continue as an extension to expand the student’s understanding of what they read. The student will continue to expand vocabulary using knowledge of roots, affixes, synonyms, antonyms, and homophones. The student will use the writing process to write in a variety of forms and purposes across content, demonstrating their thinking and understanding about a text. The student will collaborate with diverse teams working respectfully with others, showing engagement, and valuing individual contributions. The students will deliver multimodal presentations and compare/contrast a variety of techniques used in media messages. The student will demonstrate comprehension of the research process by evaluating the relevance, reliability, and credibility of information collected to create a research product.",

        "introduction": "The Grade 6 Standards provide a transition from the emphasis placed on whole number arithmetic in the elementary grades to an introduction to algebraic thinking. The Standards include a focus on single-step and multistep problems involving operations with integers and positive rational numbers. Students will determine equivalency, compare, and order decimals, fractions, and percents. Students will solve problems involving area and perimeter and begin to graph in a coordinate plane. In addition, students will continue using the data cycle by applying it to circle graphs and develop concepts regarding measures of center. Students will solve linear equations in one variable, write inequality statements, and use algebraic terminology. Students will use ratios to compare two quantities and represent proportional relationships as a precursor to the development of the concept of linear functions. The building of mathematical knowledge can be enhanced by using technology tools when used strategically and to complement further learning during grades 6-8. The use of appropriate technology and the interpretation of the results from applying technology tools must be an integral part of teaching, learning, and assessment. However, facility in the use of technology shall not be regarded as a substitute for a student’s understanding of quantitative and algebraic concepts or for proficiency in basic computations. Students must learn to use a variety of methods and tools to compute, including paper and pencil, mental arithmetic, estimation, and the use of instructional technology. Graphing utilities, spreadsheets, calculators, dynamic applications, and other technological tools support mathematical problem solving, reasoning, and justification, as well as application in science, engineering, business and industry, government, and practical affairs. In grades 6-8, the acquisition of specialized mathematical vocabulary and language builds as students continue to deepen their understanding of mathematics through communication and problem solving. Problem solving increases in complexity as students progress into middle and high school. Students continue to build upon their mathematical knowledge by participating in problem-solving activities that promote higher levels of critical thinking and analysis.",

Instructional supports are accessible in #GoOpenVA and support the decisions local school divisions must make concerning local curriculum development and how best to help students meet the goals of the standards. The local curriculum should include a variety of information sources, readings, learning experiences, and forms of assessment selected at the local level to create a rigorous instructional program. For a complete list of the changes by standard, the 2023 Virginia Mathematics Standards of Learning – Overview of Revisions is available and delineates in greater specificity the changes for each grade level and course. The Instructional Guide is divided into three sections: Understanding the Standard, Skills in Practice, and Concepts and Connections aligned to the Standard. The purpose of each is explained below.",

        "introduction": "The Grade 7 Standards continue to emphasize the foundations of Algebra. The Standards address the representation and comparison of rational numbers using exponents, scientific notation, and square roots. Students continue to develop proficiency in operations with rational numbers and solving problems in context by expanding their study from Grade 6. Students will build on the concept of ratios to solve problems involving proportional reasoning, which is emphasized throughout the Grade 7 Standards. Students will solve problems involving volume and surface area and focus on the relationships among the properties of quadrilaterals. In addition, students will continue to apply the data cycle and extend the application to histograms. Probability is investigated through comparing experimental results to theoretical expectations. Students continue to develop their understanding of solving linear equations and inequalities in one variable by applying the properties of real numbers. Students investigate proportional relationships and begin to develop a concept of slope as rate of change. The building of mathematical knowledge can be enhanced by using technology tools when used strategically and to complement further learning during grades 6-8. The use of appropriate technology and the interpretation of the results from applying technology tools must be an integral part of teaching, learning, and assessment. However, facility in the use of technology shall not be regarded as a substitute for a student’s understanding of quantitative and algebraic concepts or for proficiency in basic computations. Students must learn to use a variety of methods and tools to compute, including paper and pencil, mental arithmetic, estimation, and the use of instructional technology. Graphing utilities, spreadsheets, calculators, dynamic applications, and other technological tools support mathematical problem solving, reasoning, and justification, as well as application in science, engineering, business and industry, government, and practical affairs. In grades 6-8, the acquisition of specialized mathematical vocabulary and language builds as students continue to deepen their understanding of mathematics through communication and problem solving. Problem solving increases in complexity as students progress into middle and high school. Students continue to build upon their mathematical knowledge by participating in problem-solving activities that promote higher levels of critical thinking and analysis.",

Instructional supports are accessible in #GoOpenVA and support the decisions local school divisions must make concerning local curriculum development and how best to help students meet the goals of the standards. The local curriculum should include a variety of information sources, readings, learning experiences, and forms of assessment selected at the local level to create a rigorous instructional program. For a complete list of the changes by standard, the 2023 Virginia Mathematics Standards of Learning – Overview of Revisions is available and delineates in greater specificity the changes for each grade level and course. The Instructional Guide is divided into three sections: Understanding the Standard, Skills in Practice, and Concepts and Connections aligned to the Standard. The purpose of each is explained below.",

        "introduction": "The Grade 8 Standards continue to build on the concepts needed for success in high school level Algebra, Geometry, and Statistics. Students will explore real numbers and the subsets of the real number system. Proportional reasoning is expounded upon as students solve a variety of problems. Students find the volume and surface area of more complex three-dimensional figures and apply transformations to geometric shapes in the coordinate plane. Students will verify and apply the Pythagorean Theorem creating a foundation for further study of triangular relationships in Geometry. Students will represent data, both univariate and bivariate, and continue to apply the data cycle and extend the application to boxplots and scatterplots. Students build upon the algebraic concepts developed in the Grade 6 and 7 Standards, which include simplifying algebraic expressions, solving multistep linear equations and inequalities in one variable, and graphing linear functions. The Grade 8 Standards are vital to providing a solid foundation in Algebra 1. The building of mathematical knowledge can be enhanced by using technology tools when used strategically and to complement further learning during grades 6-8. The use of appropriate technology and the interpretation of the results from applying technology tools must be an integral part of teaching, learning, and assessment. However, facility in the use of technology shall not be regarded as a substitute for a student’s understanding of quantitative and algebraic concepts or for proficiency in basic computations. Students must learn to use a variety of methods and tools to compute, including paper and pencil, mental arithmetic, estimation, and the use of instructional technology. Graphing utilities, spreadsheets, calculators, dynamic applications, and other technological tools support mathematical problem solving, reasoning, and justification, as well as application in science, engineering, business and industry, government, and practical affairs. In grades 6-8, the acquisition of specialized mathematical vocabulary and language builds as students continue to deepen their understanding of mathematics through communication and problem solving.

Instructional supports are accessible in #GoOpenVA and support the decisions local school divisions must make concerning local curriculum development and how best to help students meet the goals of the standards. The local curriculum should include a variety of information sources, readings, learning experiences, and forms of assessment selected at the local level to create a rigorous instructional program. For a complete list of the changes by standard, the 2023 Virginia Mathematics Standards of Learning – Overview of Revisions is available and delineates in greater specificity the changes for each grade level and course. The Instructional Guide is divided into three sections: Understanding the Standard, Skills in Practice, and Concepts and Connections aligned to the Standard. The purpose of each is explained below.",

      "introduction": "The successful mastery of Algebra 1 is widely considered to be the gatekeeper to success in the study of upper-level mathematics. The study of algebraic thinking begins in kindergarten and is progressively formalized prior to the study of the algebraic content found in the Algebra 1 Standards of Learning. The progression of algebraic content includes patterning, generalization of arithmetic concepts, proportional reasoning, and representing mathematical relationships using tables, symbols, and graphs. All students are expected to achieve proficiency with the Algebra 1 Standards. The study of Algebra 1 assists students in generalizing patterns and representing relevant, contextual situations with algebraic models. To assist students in developing meaning and connecting algebraic concepts to geometry and statistics, consideration should be given to the sequential development of concepts and skills by using concrete materials to support the transition from the numeric to the symbolic. Connections between Algebra 1 and other subject areas through contextual applications may help students attach meaning to the abstract concepts of algebra. These Standards require students to use algebra as a tool for representing and solving a variety of contextual problems. Tables and graphs will be used to interpret algebraic expressions, equations, and inequalities and to analyze behaviors of functions. These Standards include a transformational approach to graphing functions and writing equations when given the graph of the equation. Transformational graphing builds a strong connection between algebraic and graphic representations of functions. Technology tools will be used to assist in teaching and learning. Graphing technologies facilitate visualizing, analyzing, and understanding algebraic and statistical behaviors and provide a powerful tool for solving problems, verifying solutions, and making connections.",

There is a sustained emphasis on reading comprehension by comparing and analyzing literary and informational texts. The student will analyze the historical, cultural, and social function and universal themes of literary texts from different cultures. The tenth-grade student will analyze and synthesize information from informational texts to solve problems, answer questions, and generate new knowledge. The student will continue development of vocabulary, with attention to connotations, idioms, classical allusions, and figurative language. With an explicit focus to integrate reading and writing processes, the grade-ten student will use mentor texts as models to write with an emphasis on argument while showing relationships among claims, reasons, and evidence from reliable sources. The student will create media messages and continue to use multimodal tools to create presentations both independently and in small groups, reflecting on their own role in the process. The student will analyze and evaluate how media messages are created by reviewing both print and digital publications. The student will continue to build research skills presenting information gathered from diverse sources, identifying misconceptions and possible bias while crediting sources using MLA or APA style. The tenth-grade student will continue to become a skilled communicator, working both independently and in collaborative groups while presenting alternate views and working to fulfill a specific purpose.",

The student will conduct comparative analyses of multiple texts that address the same topic to determine how authors reach similar or different conclusions. The student will examine and analyze literary texts by American authors describing the contributions of other cultures and identifying prevalent themes and characterizations, which are reflective of American history and culture. The student will continue development of vocabulary, with attention to connotations, idioms, classical allusions, and figurative language. With an explicit focus to integrate reading and writing processes, the grade-eleven student will use mentor texts as models to write with an emphasis on analysis for multiple purposes and audiences to create focused, organized, and coherent writing. The student will also have authentic opportunities to write for postsecondary experiences, including college and the workplace. The student will create and deliver multimodal presentations and analyze and critique how media messages are constructed for specific audiences. The student will produce a research product synthesizing information from primary and secondary sources while maintaining ethical and legal guidelines for gathering and using information. The eleventh-grade student will continue to build communication skills working both independently and in collaborative groups. The student will continue to demonstrate the ability to work within collaborative groups while presenting alternate views and working to fulfill a specific purpose.",

The student will examine and analyze literary texts by British authors evaluating how authors use key elements to contribute to meaning and interpreting how themes are connected across texts. The student will continue development of vocabulary, with attention to connotations, idioms, classical allusions, and figurative language. With an explicit focus to integrate reading and writing processes, the grade-twelve student will use mentor texts as models to analyze and evaluate informational text and use the writing process to write with an emphasis on technical writing for multiple purposes and audiences to create focused, organized, and coherent writing. The student will write to a standard acceptable to both the workplace and to postsecondary education. The student will explain and analyze how media influences beliefs, interpretations, and behaviors. The student will create interactive multimodal presentations both independently and in collaborative groups. The student will produce a research product synthesizing information from primary and secondary sources while maintaining ethical and legal guidelines for gathering and using information. The student will continue to demonstrate the ability to work within diverse teams and collaborative groups.",

There is a continued emphasis on text reading and fluency as the student begins to read and comprehend more complex literary and informational texts. In sixth grade, the student will take a deeper look at plot development and be able to explain how an author’s style impacts the reader’s interpretation of a text. There is an increased emphasis on informational reading by creating objective summaries and drawing inferences using textual evidence. These critical-thinking skills are foundational to technical reading and writing and are transferable across content areas. At the sixth-grade level, the student will continue to develop as both reader and writer. The student will also plan, draft, revise, and edit writing in a variety of forms to include multi-paragraph compositions with an emphasis on the development of elaboration and unity. Additionally, the student will be introduced to writing thesis statements. The student will be expected to have greater control over the conventions of writing. In addition, the student will evaluate the validity and authenticity of texts, and will research, organize, evaluate, and communicate information. The student will also learn to cite both primary and secondary sources and follow ethical and legal guidelines for gathering and using information. These skills are necessary for success in future postsecondary education and workplace environments.",

The student will also interpret information presented in diverse media formats and share responsibility for collaborative work, as both a contributor and a facilitator, while striving for consensus to accomplish goals. The student will continue the study of word origins and roots and begin to distinguish among connotations of words. There is a continued emphasis on text reading and fluency as students continue to read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts. In literary texts, the student will analyze point of view, interpret the author’s style, and compare and contrast texts on similar topics. When reading informational texts, the seventh-grade student will analyze how authors use evidence, facts, and opinions to support points in multiple texts. Reading and writing will continue to be an integrated process wherein the student will use authors and texts read as models when working on techniques in their own writing. The student will continue to write for a variety of audience and purposes, focusing on the development of a clear central idea, tone, and voice. In persuasive writing, the student will be able to clearly state claims using evidence from a text or personal experience as support. The seventh-grade student will be expected to have greater control over the conventions of writing. In research, the student will find, evaluate, and select appropriate resources for an oral, visual, written, or multimodal research product. They will evaluate the validity and authenticity of sources, and will apply research techniques to quote, summarize, and paraphrase findings. These skills are necessary for success in future postsecondary education and workplace environments.",

        "introduction": "In eighth grade, the student will evaluate, analyze, develop, and produce media messages that are intended for specific audiences. The student will create multimodal presentations that include different points-of-view, and collaborate with others to exchange ideas, make decisions, and solve problems. The student will continue the study of word origins, roots, connotations, and denotations. There is a continued emphasis on reading comprehension by comparing literary and informational texts. In literary texts, the student will analyze the development of theme(s) and compare/contrast authors’ styles. There will be an increased emphasis on informational reading, and the student will analyze authors’ qualifications, point of view, and style. Reading and writing will continue to be an integrated process wherein the student will use authors and texts read as models when working on techniques in their own writing; the student will continue to develop as both reader and writer. The student will also plan, draft, revise, and edit writing in a variety of forms with an emphasis on expository and persuasive writing. The student will write persuasively and use claims, evidence, and counterclaims to advocate and support a position to fit the audience and purpose. The student will be expected to have greater control over the conventions of writing. When researching, the eighth-grade student will apply research techniques to analyze information gathered from diverse sources by identifying misconceptions and possible bias. They will evaluate the validity and credibility of sources, and will apply research techniques to quote, summarize, and paraphrase findings. In addition, the student will learn to cite sources using the Modern Language Association (MLA) or American Psychological Association (APA) style sheet and follow ethical and legal guidelines for gathering and using information. These skills are necessary for success in future postsecondary education and workplace environments.",

There is a continued emphasis on reading comprehension by explaining, comparing, and analyzing literary and informational texts. In literary texts, the student will apply knowledge of literary terms to describe, differentiate, and analyze a variety of genres. In ninth grade, there will be an increased emphasis on informational reading, and the student will examine the function of a text within context. The student will demonstrate their comprehension by writing and use the texts read in class to understand the author’s craft to compose original compositions. The student will continue to expand vocabulary using the structural analysis of roots and affixes, as well as figurative language, to understand complex words. With an explicit focus to integrate reading and writing processes, the grade-nine student will use mentor texts as models to plan, draft, revise, and edit expository writing in preparation for postsecondary work and career. There is also an emphasis on persuasion, defending a position using counterclaims, reasons, and evidence from credible sources. The student will continue to work in collaborative groups assisting with setting guidelines and working toward consensus. The student will evaluate sources and examine media messages to analyze the content, author’s viewpoint, and structure. The student will select, use, and analyze multimodal tools to create presentations both independently and in small groups. The student will apply research techniques to create independent research products and analyze and synthesize information gathered from diverse sources by identifying misconceptions and possible bias, citing both quoted and paraphrased information using either MLA or APA style.",

      "introduction": "The Science Standards of Learning for Virginia Public Schools identify academic content for essential components of the science curriculum at different grade levels. The content of the standards, in conjunction with effective instruction, provide a platform for creating scientifically literate students. The Science Standards of Learning reflect a vertical progression of content and practices. The Standards of Learning contain content strands or topics that progress in complexity as they are studied at various grade levels in grades K-5 and are represented indirectly throughout the middle and high school courses. These strands are Scientific and Engineering Practices, Force, Motion, and Energy, Matter, Living Systems and Processes, Earth and Space Systems, Earth Resources. Six critical components for achieving science literacy are 1) Goals; 2) Investigate and Understand; 3) Nature of Science; 4) Science and Engineering Practices; 5) K-12 Safety; and 6) Instructional Technology. These six components support the Profile of a Virginia Graduate and an integrated instructional approach that incorporates science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is imperative to science instruction that the local curriculum consider and address how these components are incorporated in the design of the K-12 science program.",

        "introduction": "The Science Standards of Learning for Virginia Public Schools identify academic content for essential components of the science curriculum at different grade levels. The content of the standards, in conjunction with effective instruction, provide a platform for creating scientifically literate students. The Science Standards of Learning reflect a vertical progression of content and practices. The Standards of Learning contain content strands or topics that progress in complexity as they are studied at various grade levels in grades K-5 and are represented indirectly throughout the middle and high school courses. These strands are Scientific and Engineering Practices, Force, Motion, and Energy, Matter, Living Systems and Processes, Earth and Space Systems, Earth Resources. Six critical components for achieving science literacy are 1) Goals; 2) Investigate and Understand; 3) Nature of Science; 4) Science and Engineering Practices; 5) K-12 Safety; and 6) Instructional Technology. These six components support the Profile of a Virginia Graduate and an integrated instructional approach that incorporates science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is imperative to science instruction that the local curriculum consider and address how these components are incorporated in the design of the K-12 science program.",

      "introduction": "The Science Standards of Learning for Virginia Public Schools identify academic content for essential components of the science curriculum at different grade levels. The content of the standards, in conjunction with effective instruction, provide a platform for creating scientifically literate students. The Science Standards of Learning reflect a vertical progression of content and practices. The Standards of Learning contain content strands or topics that progress in complexity as they are studied at various grade levels in grades K-5 and are represented indirectly throughout the middle and high school courses. These strands are Scientific and Engineering Practices, Force, Motion, and Energy, Matter, Living Systems and Processes, Earth and Space Systems, Earth Resources. Six critical components for achieving science literacy are 1) Goals; 2) Investigate and Understand; 3) Nature of Science; 4) Science and Engineering Practices; 5) K-12 Safety; and 6) Instructional Technology. These six components support the Profile of a Virginia Graduate and an integrated instructional approach that incorporates science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is imperative to science instruction that the local curriculum consider and address how these components are incorporated in the design of the K-12 science program.",

      "introduction": "The Science Standards of Learning for Virginia Public Schools identify academic content for essential components of the science curriculum at different grade levels. The content of the standards, in conjunction with effective instruction, provide a platform for creating scientifically literate students. The Science Standards of Learning reflect a vertical progression of content and practices. The Standards of Learning contain content strands or topics that progress in complexity as they are studied at various grade levels in grades K-5 and are represented indirectly throughout the middle and high school courses. These strands are Scientific and Engineering Practices, Force, Motion, and Energy, Matter, Living Systems and Processes, Earth and Space Systems, Earth Resources. Six critical components for achieving science literacy are 1) Goals; 2) Investigate and Understand; 3) Nature of Science; 4) Science and Engineering Practices; 5) K-12 Safety; and 6) Instructional Technology. These six components support the Profile of a Virginia Graduate and an integrated instructional approach that incorporates science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is imperative to science instruction that the local curriculum consider and address how these components are incorporated in the design of the K-12 science program.",

      "introduction": "The Science Standards of Learning for Virginia Public Schools identify academic content for essential components of the science curriculum at different grade levels. The content of the standards, in conjunction with effective instruction, provide a platform for creating scientifically literate students. The Science Standards of Learning reflect a vertical progression of content and practices. The Standards of Learning contain content strands or topics that progress in complexity as they are studied at various grade levels in grades K-5 and are represented indirectly throughout the middle and high school courses. These strands are Scientific and Engineering Practices, Force, Motion, and Energy, Matter, Living Systems and Processes, Earth and Space Systems, Earth Resources. Six critical components for achieving science literacy are 1) Goals; 2) Investigate and Understand; 3) Nature of Science; 4) Science and Engineering Practices; 5) K-12 Safety; and 6) Instructional Technology. These six components support the Profile of a Virginia Graduate and an integrated instructional approach that incorporates science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is imperative to science instruction that the local curriculum consider and address how these components are incorporated in the design of the K-12 science program.",

      "introduction": "The Science Standards of Learning for Virginia Public Schools identify academic content for essential components of the science curriculum at different grade levels. The content of the standards, in conjunction with effective instruction, provide a platform for creating scientifically literate students. The Science Standards of Learning reflect a vertical progression of content and practices. The Standards of Learning contain content strands or topics that progress in complexity as they are studied at various grade levels in grades K-5 and are represented indirectly throughout the middle and high school courses. These strands are Scientific and Engineering Practices, Force, Motion, and Energy, Matter, Living Systems and Processes, Earth and Space Systems, Earth Resources. Six critical components for achieving science literacy are 1) Goals; 2) Investigate and Understand; 3) Nature of Science; 4) Science and Engineering Practices; 5) K-12 Safety; and 6) Instructional Technology. These six components support the Profile of a Virginia Graduate and an integrated instructional approach that incorporates science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is imperative to science instruction that the local curriculum consider and address how these components are incorporated in the design of the K-12 science program.",

The content of the standards, in conjunction with effective instruction, provide a platform for creating scientifically literate students. The Science Standards of Learning reflect a vertical progression of content and practices. The Standards of Learning contain content strands or topics that progress in complexity as they are studied at various grade levels in grades K-5 and are represented indirectly throughout the middle and high school courses. These strands are Scientific and Engineering Practices, Force, Motion, and Energy, Matter, Living Systems and Processes, Earth and Space Systems, Earth Resources.",

      "introduction": "The Science Standards of Learning for Virginia Public Schools identify academic content for essential components of the science curriculum at different grade levels. The content of the standards, in conjunction with effective instruction, provide a platform for creating scientifically literate students. The Science Standards of Learning reflect a vertical progression of content and practices. The Standards of Learning contain content strands or topics that progress in complexity as they are studied at various grade levels in grades K-5 and are represented indirectly throughout the middle and high school courses. These strands are Scientific and Engineering Practices, Force, Motion, and Energy, Matter, Living Systems and Processes, Earth and Space Systems, Earth Resources. Six critical components for achieving science literacy are 1) Goals; 2) Investigate and Understand; 3) Nature of Science; 4) Science and Engineering Practices; 5) K-12 Safety; and 6) Instructional Technology. These six components support the Profile of a Virginia Graduate and an integrated instructional approach that incorporates science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is imperative to science instruction that the local curriculum consider and address how these components are incorporated in the design of the K-12 science program.",

      "introduction": "The Science Standards of Learning for Virginia Public Schools identify academic content for essential components of the science curriculum at different grade levels. The content of the standards, in conjunction with effective instruction, provide a platform for creating scientifically literate students. The Science Standards of Learning reflect a vertical progression of content and practices. The Standards of Learning contain content strands or topics that progress in complexity as they are studied at various grade levels in grades K-5 and are represented indirectly throughout the middle and high school courses. These strands are Scientific and Engineering Practices, Force, Motion, and Energy, Matter, Living Systems and Processes, Earth and Space Systems, Earth Resources. Six critical components for achieving science literacy are 1) Goals; 2) Investigate and Understand; 3) Nature of Science; 4) Science and Engineering Practices; 5) K-12 Safety; and 6) Instructional Technology. These six components support the Profile of a Virginia Graduate and an integrated instructional approach that incorporates science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is imperative to science instruction that the local curriculum consider and address how these components are incorporated in the design of the K-12 science program.",

      "introduction": "The Science Standards of Learning for Virginia Public Schools identify academic content for essential components of the science curriculum at different grade levels. The content of the standards, in conjunction with effective instruction, provide a platform for creating scientifically literate students. The Science Standards of Learning reflect a vertical progression of content and practices. The Standards of Learning contain content strands or topics that progress in complexity as they are studied at various grade levels in grades K-5 and are represented indirectly throughout the middle and high school courses. These strands are Scientific and Engineering Practices, Force, Motion, and Energy, Matter, Living Systems and Processes, Earth and Space Systems, Earth Resources. Six critical components for achieving science literacy are 1) Goals; 2) Investigate and Understand; 3) Nature of Science; 4) Science and Engineering Practices; 5) K-12 Safety; and 6) Instructional Technology. These six components support the Profile of a Virginia Graduate and an integrated instructional approach that incorporates science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is imperative to science instruction that the local curriculum consider and address how these components are incorporated in the design of the K-12 science program.",

The content of the standards, in conjunction with effective instruction, provide a platform for creating scientifically literate students. The Science Standards of Learning reflect a vertical progression of content and practices. The Standards of Learning contain content strands or topics that progress in complexity as they are studied at various grade levels in grades K-5 and are represented indirectly throughout the middle and high school courses. These strands are Scientific and Engineering Practices, Force, Motion, and Energy, Matter, Living Systems and Processes, Earth and Space Systems, Earth Resources. Six critical components for achieving science literacy are 1) Goals; 2) Investigate and Understand; 3) Nature of Science; 4) Science and Engineering Practices; 5) K-12 Safety; and 6) Instructional Technology. These six components support the Profile of a Virginia Graduate and an integrated instructional approach that incorporates science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is imperative to science instruction that the local curriculum consider and address how these components are incorporated in the design of the K-12 science program.",
