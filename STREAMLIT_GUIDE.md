## Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Results

1. **Start Small**: Generate 2-3 questions per standard first
2. **Review Quality**: Check AI-generated questions before accumulating many
3. **Mix Types**: Use different question types for comprehensive assessment
4. **Check Feasibility**: Pay attention to feasibility warnings
5. **Regular Exports**: Save your work frequently

### Understanding Feasibility

- **Feasible**: Standard works well for text-based questions
- **Partially Feasible**: Some aspects can be tested via text
- **Not Feasible**: Requires hands-on or visual assessment

You can still generate questions for "not feasible" standards, but quality may vary.

### Question Quality

The AI generates questions based on:
- Grade-appropriate vocabulary
- Standard objectives
- Question type requirements

**If questions need improvement:**
- Delete and regenerate
- Try different question types
- Manually edit exported JSON

### Managing Large Question Sets

- Use **Statistics** to track coverage
- Export regularly to avoid losing work
- Clear session data when starting new project
- Keep organized exports by subject/grade

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Streamlit provides these shortcuts:
- `R` - Rerun the app
- `C` - Clear cache
- `S` - Settings

## Troubleshooting

### UI Won't Start

**Error: "No module named 'streamlit'"**
```bash
pip install streamlit
```

**Error: "No module named 'sol_quiz_generator'"**
- Make sure you're in the correct directory
- Check that `sol_quiz_generator.py` exists

### API Connection Issues

**Red status in sidebar: "OpenAI API Not Connected"**
1. Check `.env` file exists
2. Verify API key is correct
3. Test with: `python test_setup.py`
4. Click "üîÑ Retry Connection" in sidebar

### Data Not Loading

**"No SOL data loaded"**
- Verify `all_structured_documents.json` exists
- Check file isn't corrupted
- Try restarting the app

### Questions Not Saving

Questions are stored in **session state** (memory):
- They persist while app is running
- Cleared when you close the browser or restart app
- Use **Export** to save permanently

### Performance Issues

If app is slow:
1. Clear generated questions (Manage Data page)
2. Restart Streamlit
3. Generate fewer questions at once
4. Check internet connection (API calls)

## Advanced Features

### Custom Styling

The UI includes custom CSS for:
- Colored feasibility badges
- Formatted question cards
- Responsive layout

Modify in `app.py` under the `st.markdown("""<style>...)` section.

### Session State

Data is stored in `st.session_state`:
- `sol_data` - Loaded SOL documents
- `generator` - OpenAI generator instance
- `questions_data` - All generated questions
- `selected_document` - Currently selected document
- `selected_standard` - Currently selected standard

### Helper Functions

Additional utilities in [ui_helpers.py](ui_helpers.py):
- `calculate_statistics()` - Compute question stats
- `filter_questions()` - Filter by criteria
- `validate_question()` - Validate question structure
- `search_questions()` - Search functionality
- `generate_report()` - Create text reports

## Data Format
